# EASM Data
The `signalmap.json` file contains the layout for each map page on the site.  
The `*.png` files are the background for each map page on the site.  
The `*.csv` files contain all the mappings (of bits to their functions) which I have worked out maually. These mappings will be submitted to the [NROD wiki](http://nrodwiki.rockshore.net) in due course.  

The PPM data for the site comes from the [NROD Client](https://github.com/Shwam3/NRODClient) ([actual file](https://github.com/Shwam3/NRODClient/blob/master/src/nrodclient/stomp/handlers/RTPPMHandler.java))  

`EASM` = `East Anglia Signal Map(s)`
