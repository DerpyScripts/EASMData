# EASM Data
The `signalmap.json` file contains the layout for each map page on the site.  
The `*.png` files are the background for each map page on the site.  
The `*.csv` files contain all the mappings (of bits to their functions).

The real-time data for the site comes from the [NROD Client](https://github.com/Shwam3/NRODClient).

`EASM` = `East Anglia Signal Map(s)`
